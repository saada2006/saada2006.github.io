I am a high school student from the Bay Area who wants to major in computer science. I typically work with real-time rendering, global illumination algorithms, and GPU compute. More broadly, I'm interested in computer systems and AI. I am currently working at UCSF, where I am porting DOCK 3.8 to the GPU ([here](/research/ucsf/) is a quick rundown of it).

## Computer Graphics

What's all the math that goes into creating your favorite animated movies or rendering video games? Specifically, how do some movies and games acheive photorealistic graphics? I typically work on how the lighting works within these films and games through global illumination algorithms. Global illumination algorithms seek to approximate the solution to the rendering equation. My favorite global illumination algorithm (and the one I work with the most) is path tracing.

Usually, global illumination algorithms are computationally expensive, and sometimes, we have to give up accuracy for speed or have to come up with smart ways to render. That is within the domains of real-time rendering and GPU compute. I typically work in these areas to figure out how to get movie rendering tech working in real-time with minimal quality loss.
