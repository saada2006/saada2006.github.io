This was an offshoot of my GPU path tracing project. My goal was to implement more complex rendering algorithms here before adapting them to the GPU. 

The code is [here](https://github.com/saada2006/CpuRenderer).

Notice that the above image doesn't seem to have caustics. I didn't get that far because I stopped working on the project to come back to my GPU path tracer.
