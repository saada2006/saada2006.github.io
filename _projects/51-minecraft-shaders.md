Way back, I worked on Minecraft shader projects. This shaderpack is the culmination of my work and what I learned. The shaderpack includes precomputed atmospheric scattering, transparent soft shadows, volumetric clouds and lighting, 

I worked on this shader from December 2020 to February 2021. You can download it [here](https://github.com/saada2006/MinecraftShaders).

Before this shader, I worked on an earlier shader which can be downloaded [here](/assets/files/MCShader_Project.zip). This shader had some features not in the newer shaderpack such as screen-space reflections, albiet it was much less optimized.

These screenshots were all taken throughout development, so the shader downloaded from the above link will look a bit different.
